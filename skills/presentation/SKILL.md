# Presentations: .odp and .pptx

**The engine is LibreOffice Impress, driven over UNO.** It opens the real
document and saves it in its own format, so an `.odp` stays ODF and a `.pptx`
stays OOXML. Nothing here rewrites a file format by hand.

| Task | How |
|---|---|
| **Read** a deck | `python3 scripts/dump.py deck.odp` |
| **Survey** a template's layouts | `python3 scripts/thumbnail.py template.odp` |
| **Inspect** shapes to edit them | `python3 scripts/probe.py template.odp` |
| **Create** a new deck | `office.impress` — see [Building a deck](#building-a-deck) |
| **Adapt** a template deck | `office.template` — see [Adapting a template deck](#adapting-a-template-deck) |
| **Edit** an existing deck | `impress_document(path)` — saves in place, same format |
| **Convert** formats | `python3 scripts/convert.py in.odp out.pptx` |
| **Render** for visual QA | `python3 scripts/render.py deck.odp` |
| **Schema-check** a `.pptx` | `python3 scripts/office/validate.py deck.pptx` |

**Two rules that override anything below:**

1. **Keep the format the deck arrived in.** Editing an `.odp` produces an
   `.odp`. Convert only when the user asks for the other format.
2. **A new deck defaults to `.pptx`** unless the user asks for `.odp` or names
   an output path that says otherwise.

## Scripts

Paths are relative to this skill's directory.

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `scripts/dump.py deck.odp [-o out.md]` | Deck to markdown: per slide the layout, master, text, tables, speaker notes, empty placeholder slots and a hidden flag. Works on every supported format |
| `scripts/probe.py deck.odp [--slides 4,7-9]` | Every shape's **index**, position, size, fill, line and character formatting. `dump.py` says what a slide *says*; this says what it *is*. Run it before editing any template slide |
| `scripts/thumbnail.py deck.odp [prefix]` | One labelled contact sheet of all slides, for picking template layouts. Output is named after the deck, so two decks never overwrite each other |
| `scripts/render.py deck.odp [-o dir] [--dpi N] [--slides 3,7-9]` | One PNG per slide; prints their absolute paths. **This is visual QA** |
| `scripts/convert.py in.odp out.pptx` | Convert between `.odp`/`.pptx`/`.otp`/`.potx`/`.ppt`/`.pdf` |
| `scripts/office/validate.py deck.pptx [--original src.pptx] [--auto-repair]` | Schema, relationship, content-type, chart and slide checks. **`.pptx` only** — see [File QA](#file-qa-pptx-only) |
| `tests/roundtrip_report.py check fixture.odp` | Re-proves the fidelity claims below after a LibreOffice upgrade |

`markitdown.sh` is **not** useful here: it rejects `.odp` outright, and on
`.pptx` it reports text without layouts, masters or notes. Use `dump.py`.

## Reading a deck

```bash
python3 scripts/dump.py deck.odp
```

```
## Slide 1
*layout 0, master «Candy»*

**title:** Quartalsbericht Q3
*empty slots: subtitle*

**Notes:**
> Mit der Umsatzzahl aufmachen.
```

`empty slots` is what makes a template readable — it names the placeholders a
layout offers to fill. Text is listed in z-order (the order shapes were added),
not top-to-bottom reading order.

## Building a deck

```python
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, "scripts")
from office.impress import (
    new_document, add_slide, add_textbox, add_image, placeholder,
    set_notes, save_as, slides, mm, pt,
)

doc = new_document()
page = slides(doc)[0]                      # a new document ALREADY has one slide
page.Layout = 0                            # 0 = title + subtitle
placeholder(page, "Title").setString("Quartalsbericht Q3")
placeholder(page, "Subtitle").setString("Vertrieb & Marketing")
set_notes(page, "Mit der Umsatzzahl aufmachen.")

page = add_slide(doc, layout=20)           # 20 = blank, place everything yourself
box = add_textbox(doc, page, mm(20), mm(20), mm(240), mm(25), "Ergebnisse")
box.CharHeight = 40.0
box.CharWeight = 150.0                     # bold
box.CharColor = 0x1E2761
add_image(doc, page, "chart.png", mm(20), mm(60), mm(120), mm(80))

save_as(doc, "deck.pptx")                  # the extension picks the filter
doc.close(False)
```

**Geometry is in 1/100 mm, not points or EMU.** A 16:9 slide is 28000 × 15750
(280 × 157.5 mm). Use `mm()` and `pt()` rather than raw numbers — a value that
looks like points is 25× too small and lands off-slide with no error at all.

Autolayouts worth knowing: `0` title+subtitle, `1` title+content, `19` title
only, `20` blank. Anything you position yourself wants `20`.

**`new_document()` already contains one slide.** Use `slides(doc)[0]` for the
title slide, as above — calling `add_slide()` for it leaves a stray blank slide
at the front of every deck. A document must also always keep at least one
slide: deleting the last one wedges LibreOffice, so `delete_slide()` refuses.

**Fill placeholders rather than adding text boxes** wherever a layout offers
one. Text in a placeholder inherits the master's fonts, sizes and position; a
free text box inherits nothing, and that is how decks end up looking unstyled.

### Editing an existing deck

```python
from office.impress import impress_document, slides, placeholder, set_notes

with impress_document("deck.odp") as doc:      # saved in place, still .odp
    page = slides(doc)[0]
    placeholder(page, "Title").setString("Neuer Titel")
    set_notes(page, "Angepasste Notiz.")
```

- `impress_document(path, save=False)` opens read-only — use it for inspection.
- An exception inside the block leaves the file on disk untouched.
- **`store()` is a no-op unless the document is modified.** `impress_document`
  handles that; if you call `doc.store()` yourself, call `doc.setModified(True)`
  first or nothing is written.
- `save_as(doc, path)` writes elsewhere and leaves the input alone, so a
  load → edit → `save_as` chain never overwrites the source.

### Duplicating a slide

```python
from office.impress import duplicate_slide, slides
new_page = duplicate_slide(doc, slides(doc)[1])   # inserted right after
```

It clones everything the slide references, including OLE charts and embedded
media. Do all structural work — duplicate, delete — **before** editing content,
or you will clone a slide you already edited.

**The copy always lands directly after its source, and that cannot be undone:
Impress has no way to move a slide.** `page.Number` is read-only, `XDrawPages`
offers only insert and remove, and the `.uno:MovePageFirst/Up/Down/Last`
dispatches return a dispatch object and then silently do nothing (measured, not
assumed). So copies of a slide can only form one contiguous run beside it. Any
deck whose layouts interleave — divider, chart, cards, divider, columns — is
**not buildable with `duplicate_slide` at all**. Use `clone_slide` below.

## Adapting a template deck

The common job: a brand deck arrives with one slide per layout, and you have to
produce fifteen slides of your own content in that design.

```bash
python3 scripts/thumbnail.py brand.pptx        # which layout is which slide
python3 scripts/probe.py brand.pptx            # shape indices + geometry + fonts
```

`probe.py` is the step that saves the afternoon. To retext a template slide you
need the *index* of each shape, not its text, and probe prints exactly that:

```
  idx shape        type                    x      y      w      h  fill      line
  [2] Shape 2      ooxml-roundRect      2910   6625  22039   9413  #FFFFFF   #ECDFD6/46
  [3] Shape 3      ooxml-roundRect      4120   7730   2838   1043  #FF5A3C   -
  [4] Text 4       ooxml-rect           4544   7941   2203    725  -         -
      'SPEED'
        Arial 15  ·  bold  ·  #FFFFFF  ·  kern 40  ·  left
```

Then build every slide in one pass and save once:

```python
from office.impress import impress_document, slides, shapes, save_as, delete_slide, set_notes
from office.template import clone_slide, set_text, fit_width, move, resize, set_char_color

with impress_document("brand.pptx", save=False) as doc:
    tpl = slides(doc)                              # the template block
    COVER, DIVIDER, CARDS = tpl[0], tpl[3], tpl[6]

    page = clone_slide(doc, CARDS)                 # appended; index=N to insert
    s = shapes(page)
    set_text(s[1], "Three of four are past their end date")
    set_text(s[5], "Backend API")
    set_notes(page, "Read the dates out loud.")

    for old in tpl:                                # drop the templates LAST
        delete_slide(doc, old)
    save_as(doc, "out.pptx")                       # one .pptx save — see below
```

- **`clone_slide(doc, src, index=None)`** appends a blank page and rebuilds every
  shape on it, so slides can be produced in any order. Measured pixel-identical
  to its source on a fixture with text, an image, a table and a group; for a
  slide carrying an OLE chart or embedded media prefer `duplicate_slide` when
  the order allows it.
- **`set_text(shape, *lines)` — never bare `setString()` on a template shape.**
  `setString` resets font, size, weight, colour and kerning to the shape's
  defaults, which on a designed slide means throwing the design away. One
  argument per paragraph.
- **Reuse the template's own colours** rather than inventing new ones: probe
  prints them, and a card flipped to the dark fill needs `set_char_color(shape,
  0xFFFFFF)` on its text to stay legible.
- `move(shape, x=, y=)` and `resize(shape, width=, height=)` exist because
  `Position` and `Size` are structs — `shape.Position.X = 5` silently does
  nothing.
- Retexting a chart is just moving rectangles: set each bar's `y` to
  `baseline - height` and its `Size.Height`, and probe tells you the baseline.

### Sizing a badge to new text

**A shape's `Size` never re-measures after you retext it** — not even with
`TextAutoGrowWidth`, which keeps whatever width the shape already had. A pill or
badge whose label got longer will wrap inside its old width instead of growing.
`text_width` lays the string out fresh on a throwaway shape to get a real number:

```python
w = fit_width(doc, page, tag)              # tag now fits its text
move(pill, x=tag.Position.X - 424)         # and the pill behind it follows
resize(pill, width=w + 635)
```

## What a round trip preserves

Measured on this stack with `tests/roundtrip_report.py`, not assumed. A fixture
deck carrying 11 masters, real layouts, speaker notes, a slide transition, a
hidden slide, a shape animation, a table, an embedded image, an OLE chart and
document properties was round-tripped three ways:

| | `.odp` → `.odp` | `.odp` → `.pptx` | `.pptx` → `.pptx` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Slides, hidden flags | kept | kept | kept |
| Masters & layouts, applied design | kept | kept | kept |
| Speaker notes | kept | kept | kept |
| Slide transitions (effect, timing) | kept | kept | kept |
| Shape animation effects | kept | kept | kept |
| Tables and their content | kept | kept | kept |
| Images, OLE charts | kept | kept | kept |
| Text and character formatting | kept | kept | kept |
| Document properties | kept | kept | kept |
| Master **count** | kept | **grows** | **grows** |

Two findings worth acting on:

- **`.odp` → `.odp` is a fixed point.** Five successive open-and-save cycles
  produced identical property reports. Editing ODF costs nothing.
- **Every `.pptx` save appends one more master.** Measured 17 → 18 → 19 → 20 →
  21 → 22 across five successive saves, with no sign of a ceiling. The deck
  still renders correctly, but
  **do not loop a deck through repeated `.pptx` saves.** Build in one pass and
  save once; if the work needs several editing rounds, keep the working copy as
  `.odp` and export to `.pptx` at the end.

One-time normalisation to expect in both formats: a table shape is resized to
the natural height of its rows on first load. It is stable afterwards.

## QA (required)

### Visual QA

Slides are visual. Read the renders; do not reason about coordinates.

```bash
python3 scripts/render.py deck.odp          # prints absolute PNG paths
```

Pass those paths to the view tool and look at every slide. After staring at the
generating code you see what you expected rather than what rendered, so look
fresh. What to check, most common first:

- **Text overflow, or text cut off at a box or slide edge.**
- Overlapping elements (text through shapes, lines through words)
- Footers or citations colliding with the content above
- Elements closer than 0.3", or margins under 0.5"
- Uneven gaps — cramped in one place, empty in another
- Columns or repeated cards not aligned consistently
- Low-contrast text or icons (light on light, dark on dark)
- Template decoration left behind after text replacement — e.g. a title
  underline positioned for one line when the new title wraps to two
- Leftover placeholder text

**Hidden slides are not rendered.** A deck with hidden slides produces fewer
pages than it has slides, so PNG numbers stop matching slide numbers after the
first hidden one. `dump.py` flags which slides are hidden.

### Content QA

```bash
python3 scripts/dump.py deck.odp | grep -niE "\bx{3,}\b|lorem|ipsum|\bTODO|\[insert|platzhalter"
```

Fix anything this finds before declaring success.

### File QA (.pptx only)

```bash
python3 scripts/office/validate.py deck.pptx
python3 scripts/office/validate.py deck.pptx --original template.pptx
```

Checks XML well-formedness, relationships, content types, unique IDs, layout
references, master/theme sharing, chart constraints, and the slide-XML defects
PowerPoint refuses to open a file over. Each failure names its fix. Exit codes:
`0` pass, `1` validation failure, `2` bad usage or unreadable file.

- **Pass `--original` for any template-derived deck.** A template may itself
  contain parts the XSD rejects; `--original` baselines against it so the
  template's own defects do not read as yours.
- `--auto-repair` adds missing `xml:space="preserve"` to `<a:t>` runs with
  leading or trailing whitespace, in place.
- The slide check is a deliberate denylist of defects PowerPoint actually
  rejects, not full schema conformance — a schema-invalid deck that PowerPoint
  opens fine is reported as passing, by design.
- **There is no equivalent for `.odp`, and none is needed.** LibreOffice writes
  ODF itself. QA an `.odp` by rendering it and reading it back.

## Typography

**Font names you write are rendered by the recipient's Office, not by this
machine.** QA renders through LibreOffice, which substitutes fonts it lacks. If
the substitute has different metrics, your overflow check is wrong.

Verified on this machine:

| You write | Renders here as | Overflow QA |
|---|---|---|
| Arial | Liberation Sans | trustworthy (metric-compatible) |
| Times New Roman | Liberation Serif | trustworthy |
| Courier New | Liberation Mono | trustworthy |
| Calibri | Carlito | trustworthy |
| Cambria | Caladea | trustworthy |
| Georgia, Trebuchet MS, Impact, Arial Black, Garamond, Consolas, Palatino | DejaVu family | **not trustworthy** — different widths |
| Aptos | DejaVu Sans | **avoid** — no metric-compatible substitute anywhere, and missing from older Office installs |

Calibri and Cambria are trustworthy only because `fonts-crosextra-carlito` and
`fonts-crosextra-caladea` are installed. If `fc-match Calibri` returns anything
but Carlito, treat them as untrustworthy again.

For fonts outside the trustworthy list: use them where asked, size those
containers with ~10% slack, and do not trust the preview's text fit.

| Element | Size |
|---------|------|
| Slide title | 36-44pt bold |
| Section header | 20-24pt bold |
| Body text | 14-16pt |
| Captions | 10-12pt muted |

## Editing .pptx XML directly

Only for OOXML details UNO cannot express. A UNO round trip is lossless for
everything listed above; reach for raw XML when you need PowerPoint-specific
markup that Impress has no model for.

```python
import sys, zipfile; sys.path.insert(0, "scripts")
from pathlib import Path
from office.helpers import rezip, safe_extract

with zipfile.ZipFile("deck.pptx") as zf:
    safe_extract(zf, Path("unpacked"))       # rejects path-traversal entries
# ... edit unpacked/ppt/slides/slideN.xml ...
rezip(Path("unpacked"), Path("out.pptx"))
```

Use `rezip`, not the `zip` command — `zip` is not installed, and `rezip` writes
the member order and compression a `.pptx` needs.

- **Parse with `defusedxml.minidom`.** Round-tripping OOXML through
  `xml.etree.ElementTree` rewrites namespace prefixes and corrupts the deck.
- One `<a:p>` per list item — never concatenate items into one paragraph. Copy
  the sibling `<a:pPr>` to keep spacing.
- Let bullets inherit from the layout; add `<a:buChar>`, `<a:buAutoNum>` or
  `<a:buNone>` only to override. Never a literal `•` in the text.
- Text with leading or trailing spaces needs `xml:space="preserve"` on `<a:t>`.
- **Never reorder the children of `<p:presentation>`** — PowerPoint reads the
  order it wrote; moving an element makes the deck unopenable.
- Re-run `validate.py` afterwards.

## Templates

```bash
python3 scripts/thumbnail.py template.odp     # contact sheet, labelled by master
python3 scripts/dump.py template.odp          # which slots each layout offers
python3 scripts/probe.py template.odp         # shape indices, geometry, fonts
```

Map each content section onto a template slide and **vary the layouts** — not
every section belongs on title-and-bullets. Then build the deck with
`clone_slide` and `set_text` — see [Adapting a template
deck](#adapting-a-template-deck) for the whole recipe.

- **Template slots ≠ your content.** If the template shows 4 team members and
  you have 3, delete the 4th member's whole group — image and text boxes — not
  just its text, then check the render for orphaned visuals. `page.remove(shape)`
  deletes; do it before you index into `shapes(page)` again.
- To reuse a template's icon or image, clone or duplicate a slide that has it.
- `.otp`/`.potx` templates open and save like any deck; keep the extension.
- Legacy `.ppt`: `python3 scripts/convert.py old.ppt new.pptx` first.
- A template installed system-wide is usually read-only. Copy it before editing;
  `load_document` says so rather than failing obscurely.

## Design

**Don't create boring slides.** Plain bullets on white won't impress anyone.

### Before starting

- **Pick a bold, content-informed palette.** If swapping your colors into an
  unrelated deck would still "work", the choice wasn't specific enough.
- **Dominance over equality**: one color at 60-70% visual weight, 1-2
  supporting tones, one sharp accent. Never equal weight.
- **Dark/light contrast**: dark title and closing slides, light content
  ("sandwich"), or commit to dark throughout for a premium feel.
- **Commit to one motif** and repeat it — rounded image frames, icons in
  colored circles. Not a color bar or accent stripe (see Avoid).

| Theme | Primary | Secondary | Accent |
|-------|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Midnight Executive** | `1E2761` (navy) | `CADCFC` (ice blue) | `FFFFFF` (white) |
| **Forest & Moss** | `2C5F2D` (forest) | `97BC62` (moss) | `F5F5F5` (cream) |
| **Coral Energy** | `F96167` (coral) | `F9E795` (gold) | `2F3C7E` (navy) |
| **Warm Terracotta** | `B85042` (terracotta) | `E7E8D1` (sand) | `A7BEAE` (sage) |
| **Ocean Gradient** | `065A82` (deep blue) | `1C7293` (teal) | `21295C` (midnight) |
| **Charcoal Minimal** | `36454F` (charcoal) | `F2F2F2` (off-white) | `212121` (black) |
| **Teal Trust** | `028090` (teal) | `00A896` (seafoam) | `02C39A` (mint) |
| **Berry & Cream** | `6D2E46` (berry) | `A26769` (dusty rose) | `ECE2D0` (cream) |
| **Sage Calm** | `84B59F` (sage) | `69A297` (eucalyptus) | `50808E` (slate) |
| **Cherry Bold** | `990011` (cherry) | `FCF6F5` (off-white) | `2F3C7E` (navy) |

In UNO, colors are integers: `0x1E2761`, not `"1E2761"`.

### For each slide

**Every slide needs a visual element** — image, chart, icon, or shape.
Text-only slides are forgettable.

- Two-column (text left, illustration right)
- Icon + text rows (icon in a colored circle, bold header, description below)
- 2×2 or 2×3 grid of content blocks
- Half-bleed image down one side with content overlaid
- Large stat callouts (60-72pt numbers, small labels below)
- Comparison columns (before/after, pros/cons)
- Timeline or process flow (numbered steps, arrows)

### Spacing

0.5" minimum margins · 0.3-0.5" between blocks · leave breathing room.

### Avoid

- **Don't repeat one layout** — vary columns, cards and callouts
- **Don't center body text** — left-align paragraphs and lists; center only titles
- **Don't skimp on size contrast** — titles 36pt+ against 14-16pt body
- **Don't default to blue** — pick colors that reflect the topic
- **Don't mix spacing randomly** — pick 0.3" or 0.5" and hold to it
- **Don't style one slide and leave the rest plain**
- **Don't create text-only slides**
- **Don't use low-contrast elements** — icons *and* text need contrast
- **NEVER use accent lines under titles** — a hallmark of AI-generated slides;
  use whitespace or background color instead
- **NEVER add decorative color bars or accent stripes** — header/footer bars,
  vertical sidebar stripes, thin stripes along a card edge, single-side borders.
  To set a card apart use a subtle background tint, a shadow, or an icon
- **Don't default to cream/beige backgrounds** — use white or the brand palette
- **Don't ship text that overflows its shape** — shrink, split, or enlarge

## Notes on this environment

- **apt only.** Never run `pip` or `npm`, in a script or in a shell. Everything
  needed is installed; if something is missing, say so and stop.
- **`from com.sun.star... import ...` only works after `import uno`.** The
  `com` package is synthesised by the UNO bridge, so put those imports *below*
  your `office.*` imports or you get `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'com'`.
  Same for `createInstance`: services like `drawing.ShapeCollection` come from
  the remote `ServiceManager`, not from `doc`.
- The locale is German (`de_DE.UTF-8`), so LibreOffice renders numbers and dates
  German-style (`1.234,50`, `55,2%`). German content is normal.
- Macros are never used here; documents open with macro execution disabled.
- Each script starts its own headless LibreOffice with a private profile and
  port, so parallel runs — and a LibreOffice the user has open — never collide.
